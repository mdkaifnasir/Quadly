# FINAL FIX: Profile Update, Search Tabs & Redesign

I have fixed the "Action not allowed" error, fixed the search tab indicator, and redesigned the profile page to be more colorful.

### FILES TO UPLOAD:
1.  `application/views/profile.php` (New colorful design + CSRF fix)
2.  `application/views/search.php` (Search tab fix)
3.  `application/views/home.php` (CSRF fix for follow buttons)
4.  `application/views/auth/forgot_password.php` (CSRF fix)
5.  `application/views/auth/reset_password.php` (CSRF fix)

### Why it was failing:
CodeIgniter has a security feature called **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Protection**. It requires every form and every AJAX request to include a "Security Token". If the token is missing, the server rejects the request with the "Action not allowed" error. I have now added these tokens to your profile and home pages.

### Status:
*   **Registration:** FIXED (Compression + Optional Photo + DB Sessions)
*   **Profile Editing & Following:** FIXED (CSRF Tokens)
*   **Search Tabs:** FIXED (Highlighting active tab)
*   **Profile Aesthetics:** REDESIGNED (Vibrant gradients + Glassmorphism)
